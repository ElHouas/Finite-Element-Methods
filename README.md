# Finite-Element-Methods

1. Analytically construct the Galerkin weak form of equation with  Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. 

2. Enforce the alternative mixed boundary condition.

3. Cosine solution satisfies the boundary conditions.

4. Set up the  linear  and  quadratic  finite  element  approximation  of  the  Helmholtz.
